QPF - The Euclid QLA Processing Framework
=========================================

Installation
-------------

QPF is a C++ application that makes use of many of the C++-11 new
features of the C++ language.  It was originally developed in an
Ubuntu 15.10 box with a GCC compiler version 5.2.1 (Ubuntu
5.2.1-22ubuntu2 - 20151010).  From release V1.1 on, the development
has been done using a LODEEN 1.2 (based on CentOS 7) platform as a
compilation, installation and testing machine.  So the compiler you
use must be compatible with this one. The QPF Graphical User Interface
is based on Qt 5.x.

For a detailed explanation of the procedure to install QPF (and the
QDT as well), please refer to the [QLA Processing Framework and
Diagnostic Tool Installation][1] guide.
