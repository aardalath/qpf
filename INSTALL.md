QPF - QLA Processing Framework - Installation
=============================================

QPF is a C++ application that makes use of many of the C++-11 new features of the C++ language.  It was originally developed in an Ubuntu 15.10 box with a GCC compiler version 5.2.1 (Ubuntu 5.2.1-22ubuntu2 - 20151010).  So the compiler you use must be compatible with this one. The QPF Graphical User Interface is based on Qt 5.x.

For a detailed explanation of the procedure to install QPF (and the QDT as well), please refer to [QLA+Processing+Framework+and+Diagnostic+Tool+Installation](https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/euclidwiki/display/QLA/QLA+Processing+Framework+and+Diagnostic+Tool+Installation)
